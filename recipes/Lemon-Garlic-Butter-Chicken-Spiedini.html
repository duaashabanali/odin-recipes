    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white wine, such as Pinot Grigio</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, finely minced, divided</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>2/3 cup Italian breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>2/3 cup panko</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>6 (6 to 8 inch) skewers</li>
      <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together olive oil, wine, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, lemon zest,
        1/2 of the garlic, crushed red pepper, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2
        teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and
        refrigerate 30 minutes to 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together remaining salt and pepper with bread crumbs, panko,
        Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder in a shallow dish. Remove chicken
        from marinade and toss to coat in breadcrumb mixture, pressing to adhere
        as necessary. Thread chicken onto skewers and coat with olive oil
        cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C). Air fry until
        chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, and is
        until lightly golden brown and crisp, about 12 minutes. An instant read
        thermometer, inserted near the center, should read 165 degrees F (74
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt butter with remaining garlic in a microwave-safe dish on
        High in the microwave, about 10 seconds. Stir in remaining lemon juice
        and parsley. Drizzle butter mixture over chicken just before serving.
