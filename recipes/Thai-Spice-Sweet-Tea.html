    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>
      This Thai spice sweet tea is lighter, more refreshing, and less sweet than
      traditional Thai iced tea. Red rooibos and black tea steep with cardamom,
      star anise, cloves, and cinnamon. Topped with coconut milk, there's no
      better drink to serve with spicy food.
    </h3>
